# AudioNormer
A python script for batch normalization of mp3 collections. This script makes use of two Python libraries for its normalization process
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) - uses audio splicing for cutting out silence in the beginning/end of tracks
- [rgain3](https://github.com/chaudum/rgain3) - equalizes a collection of mp3 files to the same volume level
